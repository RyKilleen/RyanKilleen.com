## A Little About Me

My name is Ryan Killeen, and I'm a developer with a focus in front-end development. I currently work at the excellent[ Think Company](https://thinkcompany.com)! I used to ask Why all the time, and it never stopped.

See my work history below.

## Too Much About Me

I know that effective developers understand a little bit about all the moving parts. I've modified server-side systems, implemented dev-ops processes, and debugged HTTP headers. I've migrated web apps into the cloud. I've optimized SQL queries, integrated third-party APIs, and leveraged CDNs for fast load times.

I help businesses understand how to respect the user while building their solutions. I've worked with designers to understand business requirements. Then I built designs into pattern libraries for developers to use.

I've written ActionScript and deleted ColdFusion, and I've made a lot of mistakes along the way. I want to help others learn what I know, and I'm eager to learn from anyone.

## Spare Time

In my spare time, I like to dabble with photography (see some work over [@IShutterToo](https://www.instagram.com/ishuttertoo/))
